# fake-news-detection

In our modern era where the internet is ubiquitous, everyone 
relies on various online resources for news such as news sites.
We propose Ã  system of detection of fakes news on 
Cameroonian news sites such as Actucameroun.
This is done by automatically retrieving information from the 
latter and comparing them with those of other news sites with 
great international and national credibility such as EcoMatin, 
Cameroon tribune, LeBledParle, Stopintox, Stopblabla, 
237check, Ccousp. This work is done in order to fight against 
the disinformation of the Cameroonian society and to 
measure the credibility of other news sites such as those 
mentioned (ActuCameroon, ...).
